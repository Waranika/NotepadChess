# Notepad Chess

**Description:**
A fun project to play chess against a CPU in a minimal and concealed way. This application combines a basic text editor with chess functionality, allowing you to take notes while casually playing chess in the background.

---

## Features

- **Simple Notepad Interface**: Create, edit, and save text files as you would in any basic text editor.
- **Integrated Chess Engine**: Play chess against a CPU (Stockfish) directly within the text editor.
- **Concealed Gameplay**: Enter chess moves in UCI format (e.g., `e2e4`) while taking notes, and see the CPU's response printed in the next line.
- **Lightweight and Minimalistic**: Perfect for casual chess games without needing a full GUI.
